  <h1>Metadata - "data about data"</h1>
  <p class="green-bg">Metadata describes the data in question by answering questions like who, what, where, when and why with the goal of providing a summary view of the data. Metadata has an important role in providing provenance and context to the original data and making it more understandable, usable and easier to locate, retrieve and manage.</p>
   <p class="green-bg">Metadata is used for a variety of purposes (for example business, technical or operational) and can be categorized in several types. <em>Descriptive</em> metadata is used for finding or understanding resources (for example title, subject, genre, etc). <em>Administrative</em> metadata is used for the management of resources and consists of elements like technical metadata (for example file type, size, creation time and date), preservation metadata (for example itemâ€™s place in hierarchy or sequence) and rights metadata (for example copyright status, license terms). <em>Structural</em> metadata is generally used in machine processing and describes the relationships among various parts of the resource (for example book chapters).</p>
